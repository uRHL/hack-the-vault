Hack-the-Vault documentation
==============================

**Hack-the-Vault** (*HTV*) is a Python library and CLI to keep your write-up vault clean and organized.
The vault itself is a git repository, so using `github pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ you can create a blog directly from your write-ups.
