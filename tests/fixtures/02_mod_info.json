It is useful on web application assessments to determine if a developer has used \\\"security by obscurity\\\" to hide JavaScript code containing sensitive data. It can also be useful for defenders when, for example, attempting to deobfuscate code that was responsible for the Phishing website used in an attack.\n\nIn this module, you will learn the basics of deobfuscating and decoding JavaScript code and will have several exercises to practice what you learned.\n\nYou will learn the following topics:\n\nLocating JavaScript code\nIntro to Code Obfuscation\nHow to Deobfuscate JavaScript code\nHow to decode encoded messages\nBasic Code Analysis\nSending basic HTTP requests\n\nOur final exercise in this module will open a door for many other challenges and exercises in Hack The Box!\n\nRequirements\n\nIt is recommended to take the Web Requests module before this one to get a general understanding of how HTTP requests work. If you are already familiar with them, then you should be able to start this module."}
