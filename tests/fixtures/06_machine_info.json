{"__type__":"htb.mch","metadata":{"title":"Resolute","tags":["Retired Machine"],"url":"https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Resolute","description":"Resolute is an easy difficulty Windows machine that features Active Directory. The Active Directory anonymous bind is used to obtain a password that the sysadmins set for new user accounts, although it seems that the password for that account has since changed. A password spray reveals that this password is still in use for another domain user account, which gives us access to the system over WinRM. A PowerShell transcript log is discovered, which has captured credentials passed on the command-line. This is used to move laterally to a user that is a member of the DnsAdmins group. This group has the ability to specify that the DNS Server service loads a plugin DLL. After restarting the DNS service, we achieve command execution on the domain controller in the context of `NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.","difficulty":"Medium","status":null,"logo":"https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/4c86a642ea237dfde036963e6d182b40.png","authors":["egre55 (https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1190)"],"os":"Windows","points":0,"rating":4.7,"targets":[],"release_date":"07 Dec, 2019","related_academy_modules":["Network Enumeration with Nmap (EASY)","Using the Metasploit Framework (EASY)","Windows Privilege Escalation (MEDIUM)"],"categories":["Vulnerability Assessment","Enterprise Network"],"area_of_interest":["Active Directory","Security Tools","Authentication"],"vulnerabilities":["Weak Credentials","Clear Text Credentials","Group Membership","Information Disclosure","Anonymous/Guest Access"],"languages":["No Languages tags found"]},"tasks":[{"text":"What is the domain name that Resolute is acting as a domain controller for?","answer":"","points":null},{"text":"Task 2","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 3","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Submit the flag located on the mhope user\\\\\"s desktop.\n Submit","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 5","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 6","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 7","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 8","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Task 9","answer":null,"points":null},{"text":"Submit the flag located on the administrator user\\\\\"s desktop.\n Submit","answer":null,"points":null}]}
