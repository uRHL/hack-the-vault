The Active Directory anonymous bind is used to obtain a password that the sysadmins set for new user accounts, although it seems that the password for that account has since changed. A password spray reveals that this password is still in use for another domain user account, which gives us access to the system over WinRM. A PowerShell transcript log is discovered, which has captured credentials passed on the command-line. This is used to move laterally to a user that is a member of the DnsAdmins group. This group has the ability to specify that the DNS Server service loads a plugin DLL. After restarting the DNS service, we achieve command execution on the domain controller in the context of `NT_AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM`."],"categories":["Vulnerability Assessment","Enterprise Network"],"area_of_interest":["Active Directory","Security Tools","Authentication"],"vulnerabilities":["Weak Credentials","Clear Text Credentials","Group Membership","Information Disclosure","Anonymous/Guest Access"],"languages":["No Languages tags found"]},"tasks":[{"number":1,"text":"What is the domain name that Resolute is acting as a domain controller for?","answer":"","points":0},{"number":2,"text":"Task 2","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":3,"text":"Task 3","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":4,"text":"Submit User Flag","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":5,"text":"Task 5","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":6,"text":"Task 6","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":7,"text":"Task 7","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":8,"text":"Task 8","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":9,"text":"Task 9","answer":"ANSWER","points":0},{"number":10,"text":"Submit Root Flag","answer":"ANSWER","points":0}]}
